## Business Rules System Implementation
Last Updated: [Current Date]

### PR Summary
- Key Changes:
  - Implemented type-safe business rule validation system
  - Created rule engine with caching and batch validation
  - Implemented six core business rules:
    1. Employee domain validation
    2. ECommerce group membership
    3. Regular user role requirements
    4. Sales rep type validation
    5. Customer group requirements
    6. Customer role validation
  - Added React integration hooks and components

- Technical Decisions:
  - Using functional approach with TypeScript interfaces
  - Implementing caching at the rule engine level
  - Created reusable group validation utilities
  - Centralized group IDs and types in configuration
  - Using existing domain configuration
  - Separated each rule into its own file for maintainability
  - Added type-safe group validator builder pattern

- Performance Considerations:
  - Cache implementation with 5-minute timeout
  - Efficient batch validation for multiple users
  - Optimized group membership checks
  - Minimal recomputation through useMemo
  - Early returns in rules when conditions don't apply

- Testing Notes:
  - Need unit tests for:
    - Individual rule implementations
    - Group utilities
    - Rule engine caching behavior
    - React hook integration
  - Need integration tests for:
    - Multiple rule interactions
    - Batch validation scenarios
    - Cache invalidation
    - React component rendering

### Implementation Details
- Group Validation:
  - Created type-safe group checking utilities
  - Centralized group type definitions
  - Reusable validation patterns

- Rule Engine:
  - Caching based on user ID, email, and group membership
  - Batch validation support
  - Clear cache API
  - Type-safe interfaces

- React Integration:
  - Custom hook for rule validation
  - Example validation component
  - Efficient re-rendering handling

### Next Steps
1. Add comprehensive test suite
2. Add documentation for rule creation
3. Consider adding rule priority/ordering
4. Add rule violation severity levels
5. Consider rule dependency tracking
