## Business Rules System Implementation
Last Updated: [Current Date]

### PR Summary
- Key Changes:
  - Implementing type-safe business rule validation system
  - Creating rule engine with caching capabilities
  - Setting up rule interfaces and implementations

- Technical Decisions:
  - Using functional approach with TypeScript interfaces
  - Implementing caching at the rule engine level
  - Keeping rules as code rather than JSON for better performance
  - Co-locating rule implementations with their interfaces

- Performance Considerations:
  - Cache implementation for frequent rule checks
  - Batch validation support for multiple users
  - Compiled rules instead of interpreted JSON

- Testing Notes:
  - Need unit tests for each rule implementation
  - Need integration tests for rule engine
  - Cache behavior testing required
